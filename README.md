# XeDAQMonitor
Monitoring app for DAQ web interface. For playing around purposes only.

# Installation
Don't! It won't work for you unless you have our web backend set up (access is not open to the outside world).

# But if you really want to
So far I only used android studio. You should be able to import the project there, open it up, and run it on your device or an emulator.
